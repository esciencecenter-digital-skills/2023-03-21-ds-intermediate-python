Pictures might be taken. Black cords means no photo.

## üè¢ Location logistics
* Coffee and toilets are in the hallway, just outside of the classroom.
* If you leave the building, 
  be sure to be accompanied by someone from the escience center to let you back in through the groundfloor door
* For access to this floor you might need to ring the doorbell so someone can let you in
* In case of an emergency, you can exit our floor using the main staircase.
  Or follow green light signs at the ceiling to the emergency staircase.
* **Wifi**: Eduroam should work. Otherwise use the 'matrixbuilding' network, password should be printed out and available somewhere in the room.

## üéì Certificate of attendance
If you attend the full workshop you can request a certificate of attendance by emailing to training@esciencecenter.nl .

## :ice_cream: Icebreaker
* In your team, do a round of introductions:
  - State your name
  - One sentence for where you come from, what is your background?
  - One sentence where you are currently? What do you work on?
  - One sentence what do you wish to learn in this course?
  - In one sentence share something not a lot of people know about you.
* As a team come up with a good team name. Write it down on a blue sticky.

## üîß Exercises
Put your answers to exercises here. Forcing yourself to write down an answer helps you learn.

### Where are you?
Add a "x" in the table to indicate in which chapter you are currently working. 

#### Temperature check 11:30

Try to finish section 1 by 14:30. The "Verifying Code Style Using Linters" chapter is optional  for today (you can always go back to that section after the workshop). 
After the break (at 14:40) we will start with section 2. Ask us (yellow sticky note on your laptop) or your team mates for help if you think you cannot finish in time.

### :right_anger_bubble: Feedback
#### What went well? (Morning)
* moving independently through the material, steps are clear 
* working in groups, going through the exercies

* I like the topics covered in the materials and that it is very clear
* very clear material
* clarity of what to do and when to do it / also thanks for reminding us to take breaks ‚òïÔ∏è

#### What can be improved? (Morning)
* Unsure how quickly / slowly to move through material, but noticed that there is a time breakdown at the top of the exericises
* I had some trouble with pycharm, now I am using VScode (lost some time there tying to use pycharm)
* Nothing so far
* I missed the part where you said where to find the lesson materials so I was just waiting for a while for the othes to finish the set up and thought you would disclose that later. Maybe you can highlight it better somewhere on this document?
 


#### What went well? (Afternoon)
* liked the introduction to pycharm and testing section. looking out to tomorrow
* very clear and useful material, testing section super useful!
* The day flew by, enjoyed the material, super useful
* Clear, yet informative instructions

#### What can be improved? (Afternoon)
* I found it a bit hard to focus with a lot of discussions going on in the room, all of which are potentially interesting so you end up listening to people next to you. I'm nots, may 

* People that were moving faster than the average were told to wait for others to catch up, but there did not seem to be any real reason to...

### FYI
* The collaborative documents will be stripped from personal information and shared with everyone.
* The lesson material will be freely available after the course. In fact, it's open source and you can even commit a pull request to improve it.
